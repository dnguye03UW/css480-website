        My name is Dan Nguyen, a regular CSS student trying to get by daily life. There's not much interesting about me.<br/>
        You can just treat me like a background character. I usually blend in and get ignored; not that I mind that, though.<br/>
        This page will contain all of my work done for my CSS 480 class where I study human interaction with computers.<br/>
